# Tidy_data_proj

This project involves taking the raw data from the 'UCI HAR Dataset' and 
producing a smaller 'tidied' dataset looking at the average values of the measured variables involving mean and standard deviation.

The full contents of the original data are included in the 'readme.txt' in the
'UCI HAR Dataset' folder. Details of the analysis script can be found in the CodeBook.md file.

The dataset created by the analysis script 'tidy_data_proj.R' can be written to CSV using the command 'write.csv(tidy_data,"./tidy_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)' as per the included 'tidy_data.csv' file.
